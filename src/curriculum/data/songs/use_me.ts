  historicalDescription:
    "Bill Withers releases 'Use Me' in 1972, a slow-burning funk groove that showcases his gift for turning raw, unadorned emotion into something irresistible. Where many soul artists leaned on orchestration, Withers strips the song down to a locked-in rhythm and his plainspoken baritone — a voice that sounds like it has lived every word. The track becomes one of his signature recordings, cementing his place as a singular voice in 1970s R&B.",
